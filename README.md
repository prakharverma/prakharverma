I am a final-year Ph.D. student in machine learning at Aalto University, Finland, advised by Prof. Arno Solin, with publications at NeurIPS, AISTATS, and ICML. My research spans both academic and industrial research through roles at Adobe Research, Microsoft Research, University of Oxford, and TomTom. Through my research I aim to explore techniques for efficient reasoning and planning in large language models (LLMs), principled downstream applications of LLMs using Bayesian principles, probabilistic machine learning, and efficient inference techniques.
