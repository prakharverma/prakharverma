I am a machine learning Ph.D. student with Arno Solin's research group at Aalto University, Finland. I am broadly interested in probabilistic modeling and efficient inference techniques. For my masterâ€™s thesis, I researched on developing variational inference techniques for non-linear SDEs. Recently, my work has focused on sequential decision-making models that need computationally efficient and well-calibrated uncertainty.
